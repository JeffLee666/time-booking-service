        // and use multi-threads to rise read efficiency. In these two cases, I provide a service with apis for small data and
        // big data.

        // 1. when for notification;
        // 2. what ways to inform, like email, Wechat, phone message, etc;
        // 3. how to deal with employees who resigned and are on leave on that day.
